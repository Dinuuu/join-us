# Catawiki Hiring Process

You‚Äôre thinking of becoming a Catawikian? Nice! We put time and effort into hiring at Catawiki to ensure the process is fair, efficient and transparent.

Our goal is to see if there will be a match in terms of your technical and communication skills as well as a cultural fit. We‚Äôre not looking for clones of our existing Engineering team, but more people who want to help take themselves and Catawiki to the next level, while having some fun along the way! Equally, we have set up the process to give you an insight into what it's like to work here, a clear view of what problems you‚Äôd be working on, and an idea about whether or not you‚Äôd be excited about collaborating with the Catawiki team.

Here‚Äôs what you can expect when applying for one of our [open positions in Tech](https://www.catawiki.com/jobs/all#departments:development).

**1. Applying**  üìù

Applying to an open tech role at Catawiki is quick and easy! We will ask you for some basic information including your CV, a cover letter, and contact details.

The cover letter does not need to be a work of art from Shakespeare, but more of a small summary of what made you excited enough to apply for the role and why you think your experience could be a fit.

**Top recruiter tip:** Bonus points for including links to your Github (or equivalent)*, side projects, information about what projects you're most proud of and what objects on Catawiki you‚Äôre most intrigued by (yes, it‚Äôs true, we did once auction off the skeleton of a woolly mammoth for ‚Ç¨100,000!).

After you hit submit, you'll receive an email confirmation and your application will be reviewed and responded to by our Recruitment team within 10 days.

*Although we like and respect open source contributions, having a Github profile full of projects and contributions is an added extra but of course not mandatory!


**2. Recruiter screening üìû**

The second stage of the process is a 20-30 minute Skype call with one of our Technical recruiters. The goal of this call is to get to know each other and see if there could be a match both ways. We‚Äôll probably be asking you questions relating to:

- **Experience:** What have you done before, what are you currently doing, what tech-stack are you most familiar with?
- **Motivation:** What does a perfect job look like to you? Why could Catawiki be a good next step?
- **You!:** What fun projects are you working on in your free time? Would you be relocating to Catawiki with your family, or even a pet? Would you be interested in joining Catawiki‚Äôs Skydiving team or Board Games club?
- **The practical stuff:** Salary expectations, relocation possibilities, availability etc.

We‚Äôll explain some more to you about our history, business model and ambitions (it‚Äôs actually pretty cool how we‚Äôve scaled the business from our 2 founders in a small Dutch city to 600 Catawikians around the world!). We‚Äôll also talk you through how our teams are structured, where you would fit in and what to expect next in the interview process. There will also be plenty of time for you to ask questions as we want you to begin getting a feeling for if this position, and Catawiki, is right for you.

**Top recruiter tip:** Practice explaining some of the technical projects you‚Äôve worked on in a non-technical way, perhaps to a friend or family member, and see if they understand or are looking at you with a confused expression on their face!


**3. Technical Interview üíª**

This interview is carried out by video call (usually on Skype or Google Meet) and will be with 2 of our developers. The purpose of the interview is to touch lightly on a few programming ideas, some language specific questions, communication and overall fit. We aim to make the interview a collaborative discussion rather than an interrogation! The following topics are usually covered:

- **Breaking the ice:** What are you currently doing and what have you done in the past; kind of like a condensed version of the recruiter screening call. 
- **Technical questions:** Here we cover basic knowledge and explore what areas of technology you‚Äôre most familiar with (e.g microservices, API development, databases, frameworks, system design, A/B testing etc). These will vary depending on what role you are interviewing for.
- **Problem solving questions** that measure your thinking process and coding skills (usually done via a shared board such as https://coderpad.io//)
- **Business acumen questions:** We want to quickly touch on your understanding of Catawiki‚Äôs business and your general economic and business know-how.
- **A chance, of course, for you to ask questions** 

What we‚Äôre looking for in a candidate at this stage:

- **Fit:** Do you fit the Catawiki way of developing software, and would you enjoy it?  
- **Technical Skills:** It‚Äôs hard to tell everything in this call, but we hope to get a good idea about your level of knowledge on different topics to see what areas you could add value, and what areas we could help you to grow. 
- **Motivation:** Are you excited to develop product and have an impact on users? 

**Top Developer tip**
Preparing a few questions ahead of time is a great way to make sure you walk away with all of the information you need while showing that you have an interest in Catawiki and the role. 

After the interview, the interviewers will inform the recruiter of their decision, who will then inform you about the decision as soon as possible. If the decision is positive, we will discuss setting up the final interview which is always on-site in our office. Catawiki will of course help arrange travel and accommodation if you are coming from overseas.


**4.a On-Site Final Interview üè†**

The big day is finally here! Here‚Äôs what you can expect after arriving at Catawiki HQ. The recruiter will give you a tour of the office so you get the chance to see the working environment and set-up first hand. After a drink and a chance to get your bearings, you‚Äôll begin the interviews with a mixture of people from our Product and Development teams.

The first 2 interviews will each focus on 1 particular case to solve that is relevant to a real life problem that Catawiki is working on. The final part will focus more on fit, business acumen and career growth possibilities. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for at this stage:

- **Technical Skills:** What is the breadth and depth of your knowledge, how do you solve problems?
- **Language Specific knowledge:** e.g How to do x and y in Rails or React.
- **Communications and collaboration skills:** Listening, clarity, concision, friendliness, empathy, open-mindedness‚Ä¶ these are all qualities we admire.
- **Culture Fit:** Catawiki is an international company with people coming from around the world. We want people who are passionate about what they are doing, proud of what they have done and who can have a positive impact at Catawiki. 

**Top Developer Tip:**
In terms of preparation, we would advise on bringing your own laptop with you (sometimes it's more comfortable to code in your own environment when needed) and taking a good look/having a play with the Catawiki website and app beforehand. This is helpful as we try and base our questions and scenarios around real life problems we‚Äôre trying to solve at Catawiki.


**4.b. Final Interview Covid-19 Update**

As we navigate through this crisis together, we want to reassure you that we are committed to keeping our platform functioning and all of our employees and candidates safe. That‚Äôs why the entire recruitment process will take place remotely, using phone and video calls. All of our employees are now working remotely, and because the business continues to thrive, we are still actively hiring. Relocation is likely to be a little slower than usual, but we are still able to help with this journey and will do our best to ensure a smooth transition. You can Click [here](https://cw-app-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/marketing/marketing/corona_update/covid-19_update_catawiki_en.pdf) to read the Coronavirus company update from our CEO, Ravi Vora.

Regarding the final interview round, for the writing code part we'll use Coderpad. For the diagrams part, we normally use lucidchart.com but if you'd prefer something different like Google Drawings or excalidraw.com , then you're welcome to use these instead. We'd recommend you to have a quick play around with the above to familiarise yourself and see what you prefer. For successful applicants who end up being hired, we always ensure a safe, engaging and (for the time-being) remote oboarding experience and take care to make sure all of your equipment will be sent to you by courier so you are ready for your first day.


**5. Decision üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è**

After the final interview, all interviewers will sit together to discuss the feedback and come to a mutual decision. This will be communicated to you within a few days of the final interview. In the event we decide not to progress, the recruiter will give you a call to discuss the feedback in detail.

If we decide that you are the perfect match for us, we‚Äôll call you to tell you the news and make you an offer! If you accept, you‚Äôll begin the relocation and/or onboarding process.


**6. Onboarding üëã**

Yes! You made it and are now a proud Catawikian! Awesome. The final step is to start life at Catawiki. There will be an official ‚Äòonboarding‚Äô day with other new joiners (across different departments) as well as a full technical onboarding and orientation so you can get up to speed quickly. In your first week, you will have an appointment with HR for the last pieces of paperwork including applying to the 30% rule (if you are eligible).

We're a friendly and international bunch so there's a good chance that lots of the people you speak to here have been through a similar process and can share their top tips and tricks for getting settled in, whether it‚Äôs the best neighborhoods to live in or the best pizza restaurant to order takeaway from! No matter what happens, Catawiki is here to support you along every step your journey.



**Diversity Statement**

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you‚Äôve got a story to tell, come and join us.
