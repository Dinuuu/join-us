# What is Catawiki?

Our mission is to make special items available to everyone. We are one of the fastest growing companies in Europe. Our Online 
auction website attracts 14 million monthly users from around the globe to participate in weekly auctions across a
variety of categories for special objects. The items we have auctioned off include [a lock of Napoleon’s hair](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/1685179-paraphernalia-authentic-hair-napoleon-bonaparte), [a mammoth 
skeleton](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/6325173-complete-skeleton-of-a-woolly-mammoth-mammuthus-primigenius-5-5-metres-long-3-2-metres-high) and [the most expensive set of Lego](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/12469647-star-wars-ucs-10179-millennium-falcon) ever produced!

In 2015 we received our Series C funding round of €75 Million and since then we have entered into 15 new countries and 
grown to 600 proud Catawikians.
