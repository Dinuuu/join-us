# What is Catawiki?

[A piece of the moon](https://veiling.catawiki.nl/kavels/16212865-fragment-of-the-moon-in-a-medallion-12-15-g), [a complete dinosaur skeleton](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/6325173-complete-skeleton-of-a-woolly-mammoth-mammuthus-primigenius-5-5-metres-long-3-2-metres-high), [the Pope's hat](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/5023105-authentic-skullcap-worn-by-pope-francis-21st-century), [the world's smallest book](https://auction.catawiki.com/kavels/8360709-miniature-books-the-smallest-book-in-the-world-in-7-languages-der-olympische-eid-the-olympic-oath-1968) - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

As Europe’s fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven’t looked back since! In 2015 we received our Series C funding round (€75 Million) and since then we’ve grown to 600 proud Catawikians working across several international offices.
